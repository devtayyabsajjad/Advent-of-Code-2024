    "### Problem: Reconciling the Chief Historian's Location Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chief Historian is missing, and a group of Senior Historians needs to reconcile two lists of historically significant location IDs in order to save Christmas. The issue is that the lists are not the same, so you are tasked with calculating the total \"distance\" between the two lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "You will be provided with two lists of location IDs (`left_list` and `right_list`), extracted from a multiline input. Each pair of numbers in the input corresponds to one element from the `left_list` and one from the `right_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "Your goal is to compute the total \"distance\" between the two lists by pairing the smallest numbers in each list, the second smallest, and so on. Then, sum up the absolute differences between corresponding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input:\n",
    "3 4 4 3 2 5 1 3 3 9 3 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation:\n",
    "1. **Split the input into two lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Left List: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3]`  \n",
    "   Right List: `[4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort both lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Left List (sorted): `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`  \n",
    "   Right List (sorted): `[3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the absolute differences for corresponding pairs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pair: (1, 3) → Distance: `2`\n",
    "   - Pair: (2, 3) → Distance: `1`\n",
    "   - Pair: (3, 3) → Distance: `0`\n",
    "   - Pair: (3, 4) → Distance: `1`\n",
    "   - Pair: (3, 5) → Distance: `2`\n",
    "   - Pair: (4, 9) → Distance: `5`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Total Distance:**  \n",
    "   `2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thought Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Parsing:**  \n",
    "   - Parse the multiline input into a list of pairs, where each line represents two integers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Splitting into Lists:**  \n",
    "   - Separate the even-indexed numbers into the `left_list` and odd-indexed numbers into the `right_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - Sort both `left_list` and `right_list` to prepare them for pairwise comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Distances:**  \n",
    "   - Compute the absolute difference between corresponding elements from both lists and sum up these distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output:**  \n",
    "   - Print the total distance.\n"
